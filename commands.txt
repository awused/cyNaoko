Naoko's Commands

All commands and usernames are not case sensitive.
In the parameters, [] denotes an optional command, | denotes different possible commands, and () denotes grouping to reduce ambiguity.
None of these characters are used in the command parameters, except in the case of the translate command.

--- All Users ----
These commands are usable by all users, whether they're in IRC or Synchtube.

    Translates the given string from aa, which defaults to detecting the language, to bb, which defaults to en, using Microsoft Translate.
    The languages aa and bb must be specified as an ISO two letter language code.

--- Synchtube Users Only ---
These commands are usable by both mods and non-mods in the Synchtube chat, but not in IRC.

add link
    Adds the video found at the link to the playlist. The video is added to the sql database as if it were added through Synchtube.
    Only mods can add videos when the playlist is locked.

addrandom X
    Adds X random videos to the list, where X defaults to five. The maximum value of X for non-mods is five. Non-mods can only use this command when there are ten or less videos in the playlist.
    This command is throttled so that it can only be called by any user once every five seconds.
    Less restrictions affect mods.

delete [-n X]
    Deletes the last X videos added by the user who calls this command up to a maximum of ten. This will not delete the currently playing video.
    Due to how Synchtube handles adding videos for unregistered but named users, no unregistered users can delete their own videos, and this command is disabled for them.
    More options are available to mods.

lastban
lastbans
    Displays the last ban for the name of the user who calls this command, including the time of the ban, the reason, and the name of the mod who initiated the ban.
    More options are available to mods. Lastbans will only provide a single ban for non-mods, and will also default to one for mods.

permissions
    Display the hybrid mod permissions for the user who calls this command.
    More options are available to mods.

--- Synchtube Mods Only ---
These commands are only available to Synchtube mods in Synchtube chat. Some commands are available to hybrid mods with specific permissions.
There are no differences between mods and hybrid mods, save only that hybrid mods are not protected from some commands such as ban like real mods are, and they cannot use the
special parameters for the kick command.

--- Naoko Administrator Only ---
These functions are only available to the administrator of Naoko through telnet.

importFile(string filename, string name=None)
    Opens <filename>.lst, which is a text file containing a list of urls to vidoes (such as are accepted by $add), one per line.
    Adds every video after verifying it as if it were added by a user with the provided name. If no name is provided they will not be stored in the database.
    This function can take a long time due to spacing out the adds to avoid spamming the Youtube API, and should be used sparingly.
